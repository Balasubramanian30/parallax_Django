        <h2>What is a parallax?</h2>
        <p>
            The parallax scrolling allows the user to perceive an impression of depth. The website appears as a 3D
            animation that scrolls down the page. This operational concept is particularly well adapted to
            storytelling,
            as the reading of the contents is encouraged by the scrolling effects, animations and advertising
            displays.
            The parallax scrolling is also found in web design under the terms parallax website, scrolling website
            or
            parallax web design.
        </p>
        <p>
            The term parallax scrolling is used to describe websites whose operating concept differs significantly
            from
            conventional navigation menus: websites with parallax scrolling are operated using the scroll function
            of
            the mouse. If the user scrolls through the website, the elements of the website move at different rates.
            A
            background image moves slowly, while images or graphic elements in the foreground move faster.
        </p>
        <h3>General information</h3>
        <p>
            Parallax Scrolling works with what is called parallax scrolling. When an observer moves parallel to two
            objects, the objects appear to move at different speeds. The closer object seems to move faster, the one
            further away slower. This effect of perceptual psychology gives the observer a particular impression of
            depth, because the light reflections of the object near him are perceived more quickly by the retina.
            The
            human brain processes these stimuli in such a way that the space represented is perceived as if it were
            in
            3D.
        </p>
        <p>
            The impact of parallax scrolling is important in geometry, astronomy, photography and metrology. In 2D
            video
            games, parallax is used to create depth and to give orientation to the player. In recent years, the
            parallax
            scrolling effect is also used in web design. The objective is to improve the registration of the
            presented
            information and to design the website in an interactive way. Users are then expected to remember the
            range
            of information based on the presentation and find the functionality of the website enjoyable (Joy of
            use).
        </p>
        <h3>Functionality</h3>
        <p>
            Parallax scrolling can be created in different ways on websites. In general, background images and
            visual
            elements are inserted in the foreground so that the viewer can move through the landscape via the scroll
            function. The global image or the visible area above the fold is the landmark - also called viewport -
            for
            the viewer: the website moves, so to speak, from this fixed landmark, while the individual elements move
            more slowly and quickly. These movements are caused by Slides, Fade out, Fade in and fixed elements such
            as
            text or graphics loaded continuously via so-called HTML Reflow. The arrangement of the partly animated
            elements on the parallax scroll leads to a dynamic display of the website contents: the user
            "experiences"
            the contents as they move horizontally.
        </p>
        <p>
            The website itself is, from the point of view of its design, often a Single Page or OnePager website:
            source
            code, texts, images, CSS and scripts are in one and the same document filed on a server. The effects are
            controlled via selectors and CSS tags, the requests are managed by the effects, after being triggered by
            the
            user who has scrolled the page. In the case of multiple scripts, very detailed graphics, high resolution
            images or high rendering, the loading time of the content can be longer than expected. For this reason,
            it
            is advisable to use effects only in a subtle way and it is always better to choose a light source code.
            Ideally, parallax scrolling is part of the overall website concept, which can also be a multi-page
            website
            for targeted use.
        </p>
        <h3>In practice</h3>
        <p>
            The most common use case is storytelling. Here, the contents are arranged in a way that tells a story -
            while the user scrolls down the page. The range of information and the technical representation of the
            contents are combined. Freelancers, websites, online stores, landing pages with many calls to action,
            product launch websites and advertising campaigns also benefit from the advantages of parallax scrolling
            for storytelling.

            From a web design point of view, the following points are relevant for the representation of information
            using parallax scrolling :
        </p>
        <p>
            Parallax scrolling should be used in a minimalist way if we want to move towards a flat design.
            It should act as a visual storytelling.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It should give pleasure to the user and no frustration.</li>
            <li>It should push the user towards an action. For example a contact or the order of a product.</li>
            <li>It should be retroactively compatible with older versions of browsers and work without any problems
                on mobile browsers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If these criteria are not met when creating a website based on parallax scrolling, the end user may be
            faced with major problems. In the worst case, the website would be unusable, the information impossible
            to consult, and the website would not reach its goal. Too many technical difficulties could frustrate
            the users and also damage the image of the site.
